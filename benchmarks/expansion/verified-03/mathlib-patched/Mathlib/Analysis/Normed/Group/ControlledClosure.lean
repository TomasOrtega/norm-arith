/-! # Extending a backward bound on a normed group homomorphism from a dense set

Possible TODO (from the PR's review, https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8498):
"This feels a lot like the second step in the proof of the Banach open mapping theorem
(`exists_preimage_norm_le`) ... wonder if it would be possible to refactor it using one of [the
lemmas in this file]."

/-- Given `f : NormedAddGroupHom G H` for some complete `G` and a subgroup `K` of `H`, if every
element `x` of `K` has a preimage under `f` whose norm is at most `C*‖x‖` then the same holds for
elements of the (topological) closure of `K` with constant `C+ε` instead of `C`, for any
positive `ε`.

/-- Given `f : NormedAddGroupHom G H` for some complete `G`, if every element `x` of the image of
an isometric immersion `j : NormedAddGroupHom K H` has a preimage under `f` whose norm is at most
`C*‖x‖` then the same holds for elements of the (topological) closure of this image with constant
`C+ε` instead of `C`, for any positive `ε`.
This is useful in particular if `j` is the inclusion of a normed group into its completion
(in this case the closure is the full target group).
